Kelev Reference Manual
======================
Kelev is a RISC instruction set architecture, designed to fit in with
the processors of the late 80's and early 90's. The basic theme of the
design is, "What if the ARM had a MIPS pipeline?"

This document serves as an introduction to Kelev, and as an informal
specification for implementors.
